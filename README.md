### goals / idea list
add album art to tracks.

add functionality to download multiple songs in async, by separating each link by commas e.g. https://open.spotify.com/track/0rOLFkjY5DSIViVBNnzOuK?si=ef4a28813fb34f8d, https://open.spotify.com/track/5dl8x4xLEzZC0f927WBTUG?si=b85d64ca711a4f02

add the ability to download albums and playlists in async

these goals may change in the future but are the current goals, in descending order in terms of priority.
