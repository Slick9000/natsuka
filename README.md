### goals / idea list
add album art to tracks.

add functionality to download multiple songs in async, by separating each link by commas e.g. https://open.spotify.com/track/0rOLFkjY5DSIViVBNnzOuK?si=ef4a28813fb34f8d, https://open.spotify.com/track/5dl8x4xLEzZC0f927WBTUG?si=b85d64ca711a4f02

add the ability to download albums and playlists in async

add the ability to stream music (this option will most likely have skip and rewind functions, but will most likely not have the ability to shuffle or seek to a position in the song.)

these goals may change in the future but are the current goals, in descending order in terms of priority.
